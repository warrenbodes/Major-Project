# Major Project Porposal
This project is based on the PJM Productions film "La Redemption".  In this project, there exists two modes-Spasky and Charter-one less difficult than the other.  In both modes, the objective is to locate the enemy (Bolaviken von Everic) who is hidden in three different locations.  Evidently, this system relies on a 2d-array, and the difficulty varies between the towo modes due to the fact that in the spasky mode, the grid is a simple 3 x 3 grid, whereas one plays on a 8 x 8 grid.  Once a Blaviken is found, the game digresses to a battle between either Spasky (if in the Spasky mode) and Blaviken, or between Charter (if in the Charter mode) and Blaviken.  However, in the Spasky mode, if after three turns blaviken is still at large, you will have lost, having lost a trun every time you clikced on a grid thinking Blaviken was there and being proven otherwise.  The same applies to the Charter mmode.

## Need to Have List
- An algorithm which can place the enemies in random spots (3 in the spasky mode, 8 in the Charter mode).
- A mode selection page utilizing a function which can draw buttons and the mousepressed function.
- State variables to control the changes (i.e. going from the mode selection mode to the grid portion of the game, from there to the battle portion, and from anywhere back to the intitial menu).
- Counter system which counts and keeps track of how many times the player has tried to find Blaviken and how many turns he has left.
- Instructions
- Collision detection
- Collision resolution

## Nice to Have List
- Start menu with a live background
- An introductory video which plays when the start button is pressed (an excerpt (or more) from the motion picture "La Redemption")
- A character selection menu with animations
- Music composed especially by Dr. Jienan Chen
- An algorithm relyin on a 2d-array system which landscapes the "playing field" with trees, mountains, puddles etc.
- Sound effects (! Spasky and Charter sounds)
- Obstacles
  * Interactive animations and scenes
  * Mini games and fights
  * Consequences and rewards
- A shop section
- A character skill tree system
- Campaign mode for story
