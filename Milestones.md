Worked on project and reached different ideas to continue improving on. Figured out final ideas for the project and made a plan for future project improvements. Figured out 2D grid for the project.

# April 26
Added in instructions and fixed the "r" button which restarts the game. The base of the game has been made and perfected.

# May 1
Added in the counter system which actually makes a functioning game. Very big part in terms of foundation for the final project.

# May 6
Changed the counter system so it would be more pleasant for the user experience. Changed it so would reset everytime you find a Blaviken. Very big portion of the project relies on the counter system that has been terminated.
